## _**A robust template for increasing taxonomic quality assurance during an era of decreasing taxonomic capacity**_

### **Abstract**

Sound conservation efforts heavily rely on accurate taxonomic identification and classification of organisms. Yet, in an era of limited taxonomic capacity, confidence in taxonomic expertise has waned. Here, we present a robust template for identifying taxonomic calibration needs and increasing taxonomic quality assurance. Our method includes six steps for use in a variety of applications, including constructing taxonomic keys or field guides, taxonomic training, and conducting standardized periodic quality control and quality assurance measures. These processes include a novel combination of classical taxonomy and modern statistical methods (i.e., Bayesian inference, machine learning) that are useful in identifying important taxonomic characters and taxonomic bias, where and when taxonomic calibration is required, and measuring performance in classifications over time. The template is easy to implement, has wide application, and will be useful for maintaining high taxonomic standards in long-term monitoring efforts and taxonomic key development, even in cases where taxonomic capacity is limited.
