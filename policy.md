As a former Environmental Scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Marine Region (Department), I had the opportunity to blend science and policy in response to the publicâ€™s concern regarding the status of the Kelp Bass and Barred Sand Bass resources in southern California. In the fall of 2010, the Department initiated a fishery analysis for both species that resulted in regulation recommendations to the California Fish and Game Commission (Commission). The process was engaging and rewarding. We met and consulted with a variety of constituents, including the sportfishing industry, angling groups, NGOs, academic partners, and other state governments. Suffice it to say, not everyone was in agreement about what changes should be made or that concern was warranted. The public process included multiple hearings before the Commission, with opportunities to receive public comment. At these meetings, I presented management options and Department recommendations to the Commission for their consideration. In 2013, the efforts of all involved resulted in a reduction in the bag limit from 10 fish (with not more than 10 of all species combined) to 5 fish (with not more than 5 of all species combined) and an increase to the minimum size limit (MSL) from 12 inches total length to 14 inches total length. These were the first changes to the saltwater bass fishery regulations since 1975 (bag limit) and 1959 (MSL). A partial spawning season closure specific to Barred Sand Bass was another option considered by the Commission. Fishery recruits are now approximately seven to eight years old, corresponding to roughly three to four years of spawning before reaching fishery size. 

Despite the benefits these changes were intended to bring, the fishery has yet to show signs of recovery. This, and my work with the Department was part of the motivation for my Ph.D. research. In addition to wanting to increase my quantitative skills, I wanted to learn more about the relative roles of fishing and the environment on the species' population dynamics, beyond what I was able to glean during my time with the Department. I wanted to dig deeper to better understand species-specific differences in oceanographic influence and sensitivities to harvest impacts. And I wanted to see if we could identify new ways of assessing the status of their populations and potential climate change impacts. You can learn more about my Ph.D. research on this website under the tab 'Ph.D. Synopsis'.
