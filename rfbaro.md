My Master's research at California State University, Long Beach, under the direction of Dr. Chris Lowe, was focused on the effects of angling-induced barotrauma on rockfish survival. Barotrauma is just another way of saying pressure-related injuries. The swim bladder that rockfishes use for buoyancy control is closed, and so it can overinflate when a fish is rapidly reeled to the surface. It's similar to what happens to SCUBA divers that ascend to the surface too quickly...the gases in their blood and tissues expand, causing pain and even death. Sometimes swim bladder expansion in fish is so severe that the swim bladder will rupture, causing damage to internal organs and sometimes forcing the stomach or esophagus to protrude from the mouth. Externally, the signs of barotrauma can be gruesome - gas bubbles on the skin and eyes, bulging eyes, a prolapsed cloaca. On top of all of that, the overinflated swimbladder prevents the fish from swimming back down to depth. It was thought that a fish with signs of barotrauma was most likely a goner, even if it was strong enough to overcome its positive buoyancy to swim back to the depths. My research helped to demonstrate that signs of barotrauma in rockfishes are species-specific (having a lot to do with the thickness of the swim bladder and whether a fish is typically found on the seafloor or in the water column). My research also showed that survival is more influenced by how long a fish is at the surface rather than how bad a fish looks. With the use of descending devices, rockfishes suffering barotrauma can show high survival if released back to depth quickly.
