<p><center>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href = "https://semmenslab.org">Semmens Lab</a> at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I've spent the last six years beefing up my quantitative tool box to help answer important questions related to fisheries ecology, conservation, and management.</p><center>

<p><center>Though my passion is fish and fishery science, my interests are broad, with published works that include contaminants in fish tissues, fish life history (e.g., age and growth, batch fecundity, spawning fraction and periodicity, spawning habitat), fish behavior (e.g., movement and site fidelity), rockfish barotrauma and survival, taxonomy, and fisheries science and ecology (e.g., fishery interactions, demographic rates, catch trends, environmental drivers of recruitment and population trends). I would be remiss if I didn't mention my former mentors, advisors, and colleagues who helped shaped my academic and career paths and who have always championed my successes, Dr. Jeff Armstrong and the Ocean Monitoring team at OCSD, Chuck Valle, Steve Wertz, and my CDFW family, Dr. Chris Lowe and my fellow CSULB graduate alums, as well as Dr. Jim Allen (I miss you dearly), and my friends and colleagues at SCCWRP. </p><center>

<p><center> I invite you to stay awhile to learn more about my current research and to check out some cool photos and recountings of some fun and interesting tidbits from my previous professional and academic experiences.</p><center>
