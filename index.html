<p><center>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href = "https://semmenslab.org">Semmens Lab</a> at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I've spent the last six years beefing up my quantitative tool box to help answer important questions related to fisheries ecology, conservation, and management.</p><center>

<p><center>While my passion is in fisheries, my interests in marine biology are many and I'm not afraid to dive in and learn something new. I've published on a variety of topics, including contaminants in fish tissues, fish life history (e.g., age and growth, batch fecundity, spawning fraction and periodicity, spawning habitat), fish behavior (e.g., movement and site fidelity), rockfish barotrauma and survival, taxonomy, and fisheries science and ecology (e.g., fishery interactions, demographic rates, catch trends, environmental drivers of recruitment and population trends).</p><center>

<p><center>This website is still being developed. Please check back in for more on my current research, cool photos, and a recounting of some fun and interesting tidbits from my previous professional and academic experiences.</p><center>
