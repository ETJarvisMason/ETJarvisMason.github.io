I am in my final push as a PhD candidate under the direction of Dr. Brice Semmens in the <a href = "https://semmenslab.org">Semmens Lab</a> at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I've spent the last five years beefing up my quantitative tool box so that I can continue to help answer interesting questions in fisheries ecology. I'd say I'm primarily a fish person and I've always had my toe in the recreational fisheries pond, but I'm not prejudice toward any particular type of science. 

I enjoy many different aspects of marine biology and fish biology and I have published on a variety of topics, including contaminants in forage fishes and squid, fish life history (e.g., age and growth, batch fecundity, spawning fraction and periodicity, spawning habitat characteristics), fish behavior (e.g., movement and site fidelity), rockfish barotrauma and survival, fisheries interactions with White Shark, taxonomy, and fisheries ecology (e.g., drivers of recruitment and population trends). 

If you are looking for a post-doc with quantitative skills and who is eager to work, please contact me! 

This webiste is still being developed. Please check back in for more on my current research, cool photos, and a recounting of some fun and interesting tidbits from my previous professional and academic experiences.
