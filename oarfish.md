Have you visited the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County? Have you heard of the Catalina Oarfish? No, that's not its real name and no, the shores of Catalina Island are not its home. The Oarfish, _Regalecus russelii_ (Cuvier, 1816) (Actinopterygii: Regalecidae) is oceanic, living hundreds of feet deep, and is the longest bony fish in the world! There have only been a total of nineteen verified oarfish strandings and sightings along the California coast, since 1901. In most of these cases, the fish washed ashore dead. 

But on August 16th, 2006, while doing field research at Big Fisherman's Cove, Catalina Island, my husband Tom and I got to see one ALIVE, in the water, up close and personal. In fact, we were up so early that morning (we were fishing for Barred Sand Bass to acoustically tag and track), that we were the first ones to witness it that day. From Dr. Chris Lowe's whaler, we weren't quite sure what the tuft of brilliant red was moving through the water. Was it a roosterfish? As we got closer, Tom knew right away, "It's an oarfish!!", he called out to me. And what a beauty! Such gorgeous, blueish-purplish, iridescent colors. And eyes so big and seemingly curious about this strange bright world it had made its way into. It didn't take long for us to sound the alarm...this was big news!! Just as we were doing that, Todd Anderson (San Diego State Univ.) and his divers were getting in the water. He and his team were also fortunate to witness the beautiful creature in all its glory; when it was still very active and inquisitive. Throughout the day, other groups of folks came to visit the Oarfish, until it finally came to rest in the shallows of Leopard Shark Cove on the northeast side of the pier. Today, that same Oarfish is displayed at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in a stainless steel tank built especially for it. 

Of course, all of these details of the first to witness the Oarfish were somehow lost in future recountings of this particular day. But alas, that's okay, now _**you too**_ know how the Catalina Oarfish of 2006 came to be discovered.

Big thanks to Rick Feeney and Bob Lea's foresight to document records of all of the California Oarfish sightings and strandings since 1901. Based on their records, we know "our" Oarfish was 4.46 m (14.6 ft). ;) So cool!
